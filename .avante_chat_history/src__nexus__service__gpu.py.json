Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 62-70\n```python\ndef is_gpu_available(gpu: GpuInfo, running_jobs: list[Job]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if a GPU is available for new jobs\"\"\"\n    if gpu.is_blacklisted:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if any job is using this GPU\n    gpu_in_use = any(job.gpu_idx == gpu.index for job in running_jobs)\n\n    return not gpu_in_use\n```\n\nThis change is necessary because the original code was incorrectly checking if any job ID was in the list of running jobs, which doesn't relate to the GPU index. The new code checks if any running job has the same GPU index as the GPU being checked.\n\nThe modification:\n1. Keeps the blacklist check intact.\n2. Changes the `gpu_in_use` check to compare the `gpu_idx` of each running job with the `index` of the current GPU.\n3. Maintains the overall structure and return statement of the function.\n\nThis change ensures that the function correctly determines if a GPU is available based on its usage by running jobs.", "request": "change this to check if any running job as the same gpu idx as the passed gpu"}]
