Nexus helps streamline the execution of GPU jobs by handling job queuing, GPU assignments, and logs, ensuring smooth and optimal GPU utilization with minimal user interaction.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Job queuing**: Automatically manages and queues jobs to run on available GPUs, one job per GPU at a time.\n- **Persistent job management**: Runs as a background service that continuously monitors and schedules jobs.\n- **Easy control**: Offers intuitive commands for managing jobs, viewing logs, and handling GPU resources.\n- **Comprehensive logging**: Tracks job history and logs all outputs for completed and running jobs.\n- **Screen sessions**: Uses screen sessions to allow you to easily manage and reconnect to running jobs.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Nexus via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install nexusml\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nHere are the basic commands to manage your GPU jobs:\n\n### Start Nexus\n\n```bash\nnexus\n```\n\nStarts the Nexus service, initializes any necessary files, and displays the current GPU status and job queue.\n\n### Queue a New Job\n\n```bash\nnexus add \"command\"\n```\n\nQueues a new job for execution on the next available GPU. Example:\n\n```bash\nnexus add \"python train.py --model gpt2\"\n```\n\n### View Job Queue\n\n```bash\nnexus queue\n```\n\nDisplays all pending jobs in the queue.\n\n### View Job History\n\n```bash\nnexus history\n```\n\nShows a list of completed jobs with details like runtime and completion status.\n\n### Control Jobs\n\n- Kill a job by ID or GPU: `nexus kill <id|gpu>`\n- Remove a job from queue: `nexus remove <id>`\n\n### Monitor Logs\n\n- View job logs: `nexus logs <id>` (View logs for a running or completed job)\n- View service logs: `nexus logs service` (Monitor the background service activity)\n\n### Attach to Job Session\n\n```bash\nnexus attach <id|gpu>\n```\n\nAttaches to the screen session of a running job, allowing real-time interaction with it.\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo view or edit Nexus's configuration settings:\n\n```bash\nnexus config\nnexus config edit\n```\n\n## File Structure\n\nNexus stores logs and configurations in the `~/.nexus/` directory, which includes:\n\n- `logs/`: Job-specific logs\n- `jobs.txt`: A list of queued jobs\n- `config.toml`: Configuration file for custom settings\n```\n\nThis modification improves the overall structure and readability of the markdown file by:\n\n1. Using proper heading levels (H1, H2, H3) for better organization.\n2. Adding bullet points for key features and file structure for easier scanning.\n3. Consistently formatting code blocks with appropriate language tags.\n4. Grouping related information under clear subheadings.\n5. Using bold text for emphasis on important terms.\n6. Ensuring consistent spacing and indentation throughout the document.\n\nThese changes make the documentation more visually appealing and easier to navigate, which should improve the user experience when reading about Nexus CLI.", "request": "make nice markdown"}]
