Here's why this change is beneficial:\n\n1. It directly addresses the requirement for a 6-letter series of lowercase characters.\n2. It uses a simpler and more straightforward approach, which is easier to understand and maintain.\n3. It removes the dependency on the `sha2` and `bs58` crates for this specific function.\n\nNote that this change requires adding the `rand` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file if it's not already present. You'll need to add `use rand::Rng;` at the top of your file or in the appropriate module.", "request": "this should be a 6 letter series of lowercase chars"}]
