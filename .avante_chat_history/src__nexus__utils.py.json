This name more accurately reflects the function's purpose of checking if a specific screen session is active. Here's the suggested modification:\n\nReplace lines: 30-40\n```python\ndef is_screen_session_alive(job: Job) -> bool:\n    if not job.screen_session:\n        return False\n\n    try:\n        output = subprocess.check_output(\n            [\"screen\", \"-ls\", job.screen_session], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, text=True\n        )\n        return job.screen_session in output\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis change renames the function from `is_job_alive` to `is_screen_session_alive`, which better describes its specific functionality of checking the screen session's status. The internal logic of the function remains the same, as it already focuses on verifying the existence of the screen session.", "request": "rename this function to something that just checks if the screen session is alive"}]
